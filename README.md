online web audio api infinite walking bass generator

The goal is to visit a website, click go, and here a walking bass just starting plucking away. and it doesn't stop. Could it be a useful background sound effect for, say, comedy or poetry? Hopefully it doesn't get annoying. Hopefully it has some configurable settings right there on the page.

This will be written in javascript, using a few libraries I'm sure (probably tone.js?).
